<p>As part of the assessment, you will complete a few web development tasks in a sample project we have provided. 
 will then perform a collaborative code review during a technical interview. </p>

<hr>
<b>We know your time is valuable. We're only asking for 2 to 3 hours</b> on this. If you can't finish the whole thing, that's OK! Do what you can.<p>
<p>You're welcome to spend <i>more</i> time on it if you want, but it's not required.</p>
<p>If you already have code samples that you can share with us, those are acceptable too!</p>

<p>There is a Visual Studio solution on this VM in <strong>c:\TechAssessment\Developer</strong>.
<ol>
<li>Open it in Visual Studio</li>
<li>Press <b>Ctrl-F5</b> to run it
<li>Follow the on-screen instructions. You DO NOT need to do the "Initial Setup" task; it's been done already.</li>
</ol>
<b>NOTE: This assessment does NOT use the "eShopOnWeb" sample app that is also installed on this VM!</b> That
one is part of the Test Engineer assessment; the sample app referred to here must be run through Visual Studio.
